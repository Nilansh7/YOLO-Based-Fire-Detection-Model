# **YOLO-Based Fire Detection Model: Heading Towards Enhanced Safety**
ðŸš¨ Overview
This project implements a YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model for fire detection, aiming to enhance safety by providing early alerts in the event of a fire. Leveraging YOLO's real-time object detection capabilities, the model identifies potential fire hazards in images or video streams, making it suitable for surveillance systems, fire safety management, and emergency response.


ðŸ”¥ Features
Real-time Fire Detection: Efficient detection of fire in both images and video streams.
High Accuracy: YOLOv5 is known for its precision and ability to minimize false positives.
Lightweight Model: Can be deployed on devices with limited computational resources.
Versatile Input: Works with both static images and live video streams.
Customizable: Easily trainable on custom datasets to improve performance for specific environments.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fire-detection-yolo.git](https://github.com/Nilansh7/YOLO-Based-Fire-Detection-Model)
cd fire-detection-yolo

3. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and pip installed. Then, install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download Pre-trained Weights:
Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 weights from the official repository or use your own.

4. Run Fire Detection on an Image:
python detect.py --source data/images/fire_test.jpg --weights yolov5s.pt --conf 0.4

6. Run Fire Detection on a Video Stream:
python detect.py --source data/videos/fire_test.mp4 --weights yolov5s.pt --conf 0.4


I. ðŸ”§ Training the Model on Custom Data
Prepare Dataset: Collect fire and non-fire images, annotate them in YOLO format, and split them into training and validation sets.
Modify Configs: Update data.yaml with the path to your custom dataset.


II. **Train the Model:**
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data ./data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt


III. **ðŸ“Š Results & Performance**
Model Accuracy: Achieved on the test dataset.
Speed: Detects fire in real-time on images and videos at high resolution.
Include some demo screenshots or video gifs.
