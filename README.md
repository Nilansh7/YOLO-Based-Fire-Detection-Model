# **YOLO-Based Fire Detection Model: Heading Towards Enhanced Safety**
ðŸš¨ Overview
This project implements a YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model for fire detection, aiming to enhance safety by providing early alerts in the event of a fire. Leveraging YOLO's real-time object detection capabilities, the model identifies potential fire hazards in images or video streams, making it suitable for surveillance systems, fire safety management, and emergency response.
